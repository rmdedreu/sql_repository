In this repository I store my SQL_code

I see technology as means to achieve business value.

 ## window functions
  
  The trick here is to realize that you need to compare an individual value (the revenue from a particular line item) with an aggregated value
 (the sum of all line item revenue in a particular state). Any time you need to do something like this a window function is a good bet. 
 Hereâ€™s how that query might look:
with state_totals as (
  SELECT state, revenue, 
    SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY state) as state_revenue
  FROM state_line_items)
SELECT state, 
  revenue/state_revenue as percent_of_state_revenue
FROM state_totals;
