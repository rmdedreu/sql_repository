In this repository I store my SQL_code

I see technology as means to achieve business value.

 ## window functions
  
  The trick here is to realize that you need to compare an individual value (the revenue from a particular line item) with an aggregated value
 (the sum of all line item revenue in a particular state). Any time you need to do something like this a window function is a good bet. 
 Hereâ€™s how that query might look:
with state_totals as (
  SELECT state, revenue, 
    SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY state) as state_revenue
  FROM state_line_items)
SELECT state, 
  revenue/state_revenue as percent_of_state_revenue
FROM state_totals;

## window function first value, first name of car 
  
 SELECT 
   FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER(PARTITION BY model, year ORDER BY date_at_lot ASC) AS oldest_car_name
   model,
   year
FROM cars
  
Doing this will result in the function outputting the name of the first car. You can specify any column here, but the name makes the most sense since it is unique across the model and year.
